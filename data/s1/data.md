The data for study 1 can be downloaded at [here](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html).

The data file used is Books.json.gz

We scrapped the meta data from GoodReads. Code for scrapping can be found at S1 analysis folder. 

We also share the semantic embedding data of books, that were transformed from GoodReads book metadata by [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
